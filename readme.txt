Displays a Google Adsense Ad for Firefox only for non-firefox users

== Description ==

AskApache Firefox Adsense is a simple plugin that displays a Firefox AdSense Ad (Google Referrals) on your blog. The cool thing is that it will only show the ad to users that are not using Firefox, and only to users running Windows. Those are the requirements to get paid by Google, and it doesn’t show the ad to the intelligent people already using Firefox (or running linux/non-windows).


== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload and unzip to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory then activate
2. Go to your Options Panel and open the "AA Firefox Ads" submenu. /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=askapache-firefox-adsense.php
3. Enter in your google firefox adsense code and hit the "Update Values" Button.
4. Add the code on your pages by including <?php if(function_exists('aa_firefox_ad'))aa_firefox_ad();?> in your templates (1 per page, 1 ad per page).
